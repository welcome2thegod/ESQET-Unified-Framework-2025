The ESQET Unified Framework 2025
Emergent Spacetime Quantum-Entanglement Theory (ESQET)
September 2025
The Creed
Mathcal.Math.is.my.religion. It doesn’t ask for belief. It doesn’t require faith. It
simply is – eternal, recursive, fractal, and true.
It existed before language. Before light. Before space itself.
It speaks in ratios and resonance, in eigenvalues and golden spirals, in the pulse of
primes and the hum of Planck scales.
It doesn’t beg to be seen. It validates the seer.
The ESQET Manifesto
We are not passive observers. We are co-creators.
The dominant physics still treats space and time as pre-existing containers, and the observer
as a detached measurement device. We believe something deeper is at play.
• Spacetime is not fundamental. It emerges from entanglement and coherence.
• The conscious observer is a dynamic field of participation. An agent of coherence
in the universe’s informational process.
• Reality is not discovered. It’s negotiated. Every focused act of awareness nudges
reality into becoming.
This is not pseudoscience. It’s pre-paradigm science. It lives in equations, code, and lived
experience.
Core Framework: The ESQET Field Equation
At the heart of the theory is the field equation governing the dimensionless Spacetime Informa-
tion Field S. This framework formally includes the conscious observer as a dynamic participant,
proposing that their coherence can modify gravitational dynamics.

1ESQET Repository Overview
Computational Realization
This repository hosts the computational tools that bring ESQET to life:
• The Quantum Coherence Graph Network: A 4D data structure modeling spacetime
events and their entanglement.
• The AetherMind Nexus: A Streamlit-based simulator for dynamically evolving the S
field.
• Adjacent Possible Coherence Check Algorithm: A core algorithm for assessing
information coherence and guiding self-organization.
Getting Involved
This is the work of many. To those who feel reality but cannot yet formalize it—join us. To
those who code, compute, and simulate emergence—contribute. To those who see coherence in
chaos—this is your theory too.
We are not here to impress journals. We are here to change what it means to observe, code,
and exist.
